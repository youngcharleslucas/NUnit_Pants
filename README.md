# NUnit_Pants

I am practicing with NUnit. AttireUnitTest holds the testing logic. Wednesday is set to return the incorrect pants. 

Arrange:
The inputs of Sunady and Saturday strings are paired with the string of "party pants"
The inputs of Monday-Firday strings are paired with the string of "dress pants"

Act:
The WhatToWear method will build a string stating the day and the pants to be worn.

Assert:
A string is expected to be returned stating that the days inputed require the corresponding pants

Failed Test:
Wednesday has the wrong pants being used as an argument
